script to download mp3 from youtube video without id (clean)
--
you must have noticed that while using youtube-dl, if you try to use
--extract-audio --audio-format mp3, it surely downloads the mp3 for you
but you have to remove the youtubeid from the end of file. ydmp3clean 
automates the process. you just type in the youtube url and voila!
